## Brief Bio
I'm a Software Engineer at Hithink RoyalFlush Information Network Co., Ltd. in China. Previously, I was on the research team at Tencent. My Ph.D. journey was at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in Chengdu, where I was fortunate to be mentored by Professor Zenglin Xu. My focus is on harnessing language models for a variety of downstream tasks, and recently, I've been delving into the fascinating world of multi-modality tasks.
